# Facial Recognition Attendance System
This is a facial recognition attendance system designed and developed by me and my friend. The project is created as a part of the coursework for the sixth semester of college.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to automate the process of taking attendance in a classroom or lecture hall using facial recognition technology. The system uses a camera to capture the image of the student and then processes the image to identify the student's face. The system then checks the identified face against a database of student faces to mark attendance.

# How to Use the System
The facial recognition attendance system is easy to use. The following steps should be followed to mark attendance:

Run the application on your computer.
Enter the course details and the number of students in the class.
Capture images of the students using the camera.
The system will automatically mark attendance for each student based on their face.
# Requirements
To use this system, you will need the following:

1. A computer with a webcam.
2. Python 3.x installed on your computer.
3. OpenCV library installed on your computer.
4. NumPy library installed on your computer.
# Credits
This project is developed by me and My friend. The team members are:

# Conclusion
We hope that this facial recognition attendance system will be useful for both students and professors. We believe that this system will help to reduce the time and effort required to take attendance manually. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or feedback about the system. Thank you for using our system!
